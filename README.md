# Eleventh: Lambda Function Synchronization

This gem will synchronize Amazon Web Services Lambda functions locally for your development ease. This will allow you to easily edit the functions and configuration, write tests for your functions or add them to version control.

## Preparation

Log in to your AWS account and do the following:

- [IAM] Create a new user to access your Lambda functions. I called my user `eleventh`. Take note of the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.
- [IAM] Go to your new user and click the `Attach Policy` button. Choose the `AWSLambdaFullAccess` policy and attach it.

## Installation

    gem install eleventh

You will also need to setup and configure the AWS CLI if you haven't done so. This utility will make use of your stored credentials.

    aws configure

If you have already configured the AWS CLI you can also set up a new profile for your Lambda management.

    aws configure --profile eleventh

More information here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

## Usage

### Project initialization

Create a project and sync your Lambda functions

    eleventh init <project_name>

By default it will use the `us-west-2` region and `default` profile_name. If you require a different region use the `--region` option. If you require a different profile_name use the `--profile_name` option.

    eleventh init <project_name> --region us-west-2 --profile_name eleventh

### Project synchonization

To sync all local changes to AWS Lambda

    cd project_name

    eleventh sync

## Project Structure

```
project_name
  |
  |--- eleventh.json (eleventh configuration file)
  |
  |--- builds (zip archives of your code)
  |
  |--- functions
         |
         |--- <FunctionName>
                |
                |--- index.js (your function code)
                |--- lambda.json (your function configuration)
```
